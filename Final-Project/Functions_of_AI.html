            <h2>Key Functions of AI</h2>
            <h3>1. Learning</h3>
            <p>AI systems use various algorithms to analyze data and learn from it. This includes supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning methods.</p>

            <h3>2. Reasoning</h3>
            <p>AI can make decisions based on logical reasoning and data. Examples include diagnosing diseases or solving complex problems in business and science.</p>

            <h3>3. Perception</h3>
            <p>Through sensors and processing tools, AI systems can perceive their environment. Applications include facial recognition, object detection, and speech processing.</p>

            <h3>4. Interaction</h3>
            <p>AI systems can interact with humans through natural language processing (e.g., chatbots) or physical responses (e.g., robots).</p>
